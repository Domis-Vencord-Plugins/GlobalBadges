> To add custom plugins, you need to build Vencord from source. Follow [this Guide](https://docs.vencord.dev/installing/) if you haven't done this yet

> [!WARNING]  
> This plugin uses a custom API. Please be aware that requests will be sent to my API. However, no IP addresses are logged. The API is open source and you can self-host it if you prefer. You can find the repository [here](https://github.com/domi-btnr/ClientModBadges-API)

## Installing
If you don't know how to install custom Plugins, follow [this Guide](https://docs.vencord.dev/installing/custom-plugins/)

### Adding Custom Badges
To display custom badges, you can either use supported client mods that offer custom badges (e.g., becoming a Vencord Sponsor) or add your badges via [BadgeVault](https://github.com/WolfPlugs/BadgeVault#how-to-add-your-badge). Please note that it may take up to one hour for your badge to appear after it has been approved by the BadgeVault review team.
